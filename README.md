    My name is Magar Dew Cruz. Some might find my name strange because of its uniqueness but for short you can just call me _Magar or Mags_, that's what people around me says my name. I am currently 15 years old, and I am a grade 9 student from Ateneo de Naga University. I transferred to ADNU when I was grade 7. I really did enjoy my first year on Ateneo but unfortunately, CoVid-19 got worse. But even though we're in a different mode of learning right now, it gave me lots of opportunities to improve some of my skills. Like making a website :)) I am also a Gemini who doesn't have a talent but is willing to be adventurous so I can have one.

I love Nirvana because their songs are just giving me the coming of age vibe. Their songs are loud but it's helpful every time I feel so frustrated in the noises around me so their music is a great replacement for the annoying noises. Some of my favorite songs from them are Smells Like Teen Spirit, Come As You are and In Bloom.
