## Hello! Get-To-Know Me

This page is containing some facts about myself which might help you to get to know me more.

I will be putting some fun informations about myself such as my hobbies, favorite things/ stuffs, some of my goals, etc.

### Me

My name is Magar Dew Cruz. Some might find my name strange because of its uniqueness but for short you can just call me _Magar or Mags_, that's what people around me says my name.
I am currently 15 years old, and I am a grade 9 student from Ateneo de Naga University. I transferred to ADNU when I was grade 7. I really did enjoy my first year on Ateneo but unfortunately, CoVid-19 got worse. But even though we're in a different mode of learning right now, it gave me lots of opportunities to improve some of my skills. Like making a website :)) I am also a Gemini who doesn't have a talent but is willing to be adventurous so I can have one.
