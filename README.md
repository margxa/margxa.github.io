 My name is Magar Dew Cruz. Some might find my name strange because of its uniqueness but for short you can just call me _Magar or Mags_, that's what people around me says my name. I am currently 15 years old, and I am a grade 9 student from Ateneo de Naga University. I transferred to ADNU when I was grade 7. I really did enjoy my first year on Ateneo but unfortunately, CoVid-19 got worse. But even though we're in a different mode of learning right now, it gave me lots of opportunities to improve some of my skills. Like making a website :)) I am also a Gemini who doesn't have a talent but is willing to be adventurous so I can have one.

I love Nirvana because their songs are just giving me the coming of age vibe. Their songs are loud but it's helpful every time I feel so frustrated in the noises around me so their music is a great replacement for the annoying noises. Some of my favorite songs from them are Smells Like Teen Spirit, Come As You are and In Bloom.

This is The 1975. I like them specifically for their calming and wholseome songs. Their music is everything to me especially that I can relate to some of their lyrics. I love all of their albums and they are also perfect for night drives. Love It If We Made It, Somebody Else, Settle Down, Girls and The Sound are my Top 5 from them.

This is Up Dharma Down, this is an OPM band. I do believe that even though there's a lot of people who knows them already, I still think they're underrated, in my opinion. Because I don't know a lot of people who talk about them and their songs and if you're probably visiting my website, you should listen to them. I really appreciate their songs and I think Filipino's should hype their songs more even though they already disbanded. And we should pay more attention to locals because they deserve more recognition. Some of my favorites from them are Tadhana, Luna, Anino, Indak, and Unti-Unti.

**These artists/ bands are also some of my favorites.**

Taylor Swift

The Beatles

TV Girl

Lana del Rey

IV Of Spades

**Books**

The Invisibile Life of Addie Larue 

Little Women

Pride & Prejudice
