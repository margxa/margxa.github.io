 My name is Magar Dew Cruz. Some might find my name strange because of its uniqueness but for short you can just call me _Magar or Mags_, that's what people around me says my name. I am currently 15 years old, and I am a grade 9 student from Ateneo de Naga University. I transferred to ADNU when I was grade 7. I really did enjoy my first year on Ateneo but unfortunately, CoVid-19 got worse. But even though we're in a different mode of learning right now, it gave me lots of opportunities to improve some of my skills. Like making a website :)) I am also a Gemini who doesn't have a talent but is willing to be adventurous so I can have one.

Listening to music

Making daily vlogs

I love Nirvana because their songs are just giving me the coming of age vibe. Their songs are loud but it's helpful every time I feel so frustrated in the noises around me so their music is a great replacement for the annoying noises. Some of my favorite songs from them are Smells Like Teen Spirit, Come As You are and In Bloom.

This is The 1975. I like them specifically for their calming and wholseome songs. Their music is everything to me especially that I can relate to some of their lyrics. I love all of their albums and they are also perfect for night drives. Love It If We Made It, Somebody Else, Settle Down, Girls and The Sound are my Top 5 from them.

This band is an OPM band. I do believe that even though there's a lot of people who knows them already, I still think they're underrated, in my opinion. Because I don't know a lot of people who talk about them and their songs and if you're probably visiting my website, you should listen to them. I really appreciate their songs and I think Filipino's should hype their songs even though they already disband.
